Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, using the HTML canvas drawing methods to show the state of the world. The board has play, pause, and step buttons. In addition, there is a field where the user can update the size of the board.

The state of the board is initialized randomly every time the user updates the board or refreshes the page - thus the board has a different starting state every time.
